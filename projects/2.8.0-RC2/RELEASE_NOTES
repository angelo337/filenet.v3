Features
--------------
1. The connector crawls all documents which are supported by IBM FileNet server 3.5.2.
2. The connector always runs in an incremental mode and keeps feeding the updated documents to the Google Search Appliance (GSA).
3. The auditing feature ensures that documents are deleted from the GSA index when they are deleted from the repository.
4. The connector handles serve-time authentication and authorization.

Steps to deploy patch
---------------------
1. Stop connector service (If running).
2. Navigate to the folder CONNECTOR_HOME\Tomcat\webapps\connector-manager\WEB-INF\lib.
3. Replace the existing connector-file.jar with the latest jar.
4. Open the connectorInstance.xml file, Add the following lines
         <property name="useIDForChangeDetection" value="true"/>
         <property name="is_public" value="false"/>
   just after the line
   <bean id="FileConnectorInstance"
          class="com.google.enterprise.connector.filenet3.FileConnector"
          parent="filenet-connector-defaults"
          singleton="false">

5. Navigate to the folder CONNECTOR_HOME\Tomcat\webapps\connector-manager\WEB-INF\connectors\Filenet_P8_3.5.2\<Connector Instance>.
6. Delete <Connector Instance>_state.txt file.
7. Start the connector service.

Note :
<property name="useIDForChangeDetection" value="true"/> : Connector will use document ID for change detection.
<property name="useIDForChangeDetection" value="false"/> : Connector will not use document ID for change detection.

<property name="is_public" value="true"/> : Connector will feed all the crawled documents as ‘Public’ documents.
<property name="is_public" value="false"/> : Connector will feed all the crawled documents as ‘Secure’ documents.

Issues Fixed
------------
- [Issue 4445625] : Remove 'Make Public' Check box from connector Configuration page.
Description :
O 'Make Public' check box on connector configuration page allows to configure connector to send public feeds.
Since GSA has provision to configure connector to send public feeds and no any other connector provides this
type of configuration element, to keep FileNet connector consistent with other connector 'Make Public' check box is removed from configuration page.
O For backward compatibility, Added ‘is_public’ property in the ConnectorInstance.xml with default value as ‘false’
hence the connector will send the secure feed to the GSA.To configure the connector to send public feed,
modify the ConnectorInstance.xml set the ‘is_public’ property value to ‘true’.

<property name="is_public" value="true"/> : Connector will feed all the crawled documents as ‘Public’ documents.
<property name="is_public" value="false"/> : Connector will feed all the crawled documents as ‘Secure’ documents.

- [Issue 4352584] : Authorization failing due comparison criterion.
Description:
O FileNet connector fails to authorize the user with Email id or any other user identity format and
logs error messages as "INFO: User abc@yyyy.com is NOT authorized for document Id %<Doc id to authorize>%7D".

- [Issue 4348956] : To Provide 'Additional Delete Clause' on connector configuration page for sending delete feed
for documents matching particular condition.
Description:
O To Delete the documents indexed on GSA which does not match the condition specified in the
'Addition Where Clause' added 'Additional Delete Clause' field on connector configuration page
to send delete feed for documents matching particular condition.

- [Issue 4445643] : Provision to set the ID comparison criteria for change detection.
Description:
O There is no provision for the user to specify whether to use ID for change detection while crawling.
Currently connector uses ID and last_modified_date for change detection by default and there is no option to ignore IDs.
O This provision is given in ConnectorInstance.xml with default value as ‘true’.
<property name="useIDForChangeDetection" value="true"/> : Connector will use document ID for change detection.
<property name="useIDForChangeDetection" value="false"/> : Connector will not use document ID for change detection.

- [Issue 4444700] : Crawling specific subclass of the document class.
Description:
O Currently, there is no provision to crawl specific sub class of document class;
hence FileNet connector crawls all the documents under the Document class and it’s subclasses.
There should be a provision to crawl a specific subclass of document class instead of crawling all the documents
of the document class.
O Added provision to enter FileNet query specifying the sub class name to crawl the documents under
that sub class as Additional_Where_Clause and Additional_Delete_Clause.

Sample Query : SELECT Id,DateLastModified FROM CustomClass WHERE VersionStatus=1 and ContentSize IS NOT NULL
CustomClass - Custom sub class of the Document class.

Known Limitations
-------------------
- Issue 11: Documents which are checked in as only minor version and don't have any major version at all, will not be crawled.
- Issue 14: Few words are displayed in English on connector configuration page in GSA when we change the language on IE & Mozilla browsers.
- 'Deny' permissions are not honored for ACL check in authorization.
- Security policies applied over the document class or individual document are not honored for authorization.
- Federated documents (Documents physically present in external repository and referred in FileNet repository) will not be crawled.
- Query to send delete feeds for the documents removed from FileNet repository cannot be customized.
- Folder level security is not honored in authorization.
- Marking set security is not honored in authorization.
