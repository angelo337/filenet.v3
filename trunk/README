Welcome to the Google Enterprise Connector for FileNet P8 3.5.2!

The Google Enterprise connector framework enables Google search
appliances to search and serve documents stored in non-Web
repositories, such as enterprise content management systems.  
An enterprise content management (ECM) system provides a central
repository for large numbers of documents.

This FileNet P8 3.5.2 Connector provides access to documents
and document meta-data stored in the FileNet P8 Content
 Manager 3.5.2 developed by the IBM Corporation.

The FileNet P8 3.5.2 Connector communicates with the Content
Manager using the Java language Application Programming 
Interface (API). To properly build this connector you will need
access to the API
The API is a commercial product from the IBM Corporation and
is not included in this distribution.
