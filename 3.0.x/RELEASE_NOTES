Release 3.0.4, December 2012
============================

This is an upgrade release with bug fixes and added support for FileNet P8 5.0
and 5.1 versions.  Users of previous versions are encouraged to upgrade.

Summary of Changes
------------------
Follwing changes are only made to the P8 4.x connector:
  * Fix issue: Unable to persist the FileNet connector configuration.  This fix
    is to make changes to the connection so that the Domain object will be
    fetched from the server before the connector fetches the object store.
  * Fix bug 6513826: Add less verbose logging level for MBean messages.  Raised
    the level of the javax.management package to SEVERE, matching the other core
    packages (such as javax.net and org.springframework).



Release 2.0, June 22, 2009
==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a major release with new features. Users of previous releases should 
check the "Version Compatibility" section below for instructions on how to use
existing data with this new release.

Summary of Changes
------------------

New features:
-------------
  * "Additional WHERE clause" on Google Search Appliance (GSA) Admin
    Configuration page UI.  The "Additional WHERE Clause" is part of the query
    string that is used by the connector instance during its traversal process.
    Previously this was part of advanced configuration in connectorInstance.xml
    file.

Issues fixed from last release:
-------------------------------
  * Issue 2: Log complete stack trace when there is an exception 
  * Issue 3: When the user lets a blank value when saving the connector
    configuration on the GSA, The message "No connector configuration returned
    by the connector manager. null" appears in the screen and a folder
    <connectorinstance_name> is created with a .properties file.
  * Issue 8: If Auditing is enabled for the ObjectStore in FileNet server, then 
    connector will send only the deleted document's list to appliance to remove
    those documents from the index. Earlier, for every operation/event on the
    documents, after keeping Auditing On for the FileNet ObjectStore, all those
    documents were sent to appliance to get removed from the index.
  * Issue 9: The connector configuration form has been made XHTML compliance.
  * Issue 10: Fixed issue of DeleteFeed, in which documents were not getting
    removed from the appliance's index, when they are deleted from the FileNet
    server.

Version Compatibility
---------------------
Connector instances created using 1.x versions cannot be used with this version.
This version works with Connector Manager version 2.0.0. Earlier versions of the
Connector Manager will not work correctly with this version of the connector.

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
  * Issue 11: Documents which are checked in as only minor version and don't
    have any major version at all, will not be crawled.
