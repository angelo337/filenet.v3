==========================

Introduction
------------
This is a major release with new features. Users of previous releases should check the "Version Compatibility" section below for instructions on how to use existing data with this new release.

Summary of Changes
------------------
New features:
---------------
1. "Additional WHERE clause" on Google Search Aappliance (GSA) Admin Configuration page UI
The "Additional WHERE Clause" is part of the query string that is used by the connector instance during its traversal process. Previously this was part of advanced configuration in connectorInstance.xml file.

Issues fixed from last release:
---------------------------------
- Issue 2: Log complete stack trace when there is an exception 
- Issue 3: When the user lets a blank value when saving the connector configuration on the GSA, The message "No connector configuration returned by the connector manager. null" appears in the screen and a folder <connectorinstance_name> is created with a .properties file.
- Issue 8: If Auditing is enabled for the ObjectStore in FileNet server, then connector will send only the deleted document's list to appliance to remove those documents from the index. Earlier, for every operation/event on the documents, after keeping Auditing On for the FileNET ObjectStore, all those documents were sent to appliance to get removed from the index.
- Issue 9: The connector configuration form has been made XHTML compliance.
- Issue 10: Fixed issue of DeleteFeed, in which documents were not getting removed from the appliance's index, when they are deleted from the FileNet server.

Known Issues/Limitations
------------------------
- Issue 11: Documents which are checked in as only minor version and don't have any major version at all, will not be crawled.
